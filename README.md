# Wardrobe 
## What is it and what will it do?
Wardrobe is a desktop app that models the user's wardrobe. It records one's apparel collection, 
including clothes, pants, shoes, and accessories all in one place.
It allows users to keep track many features of their apparel collection, includingï¼š

- category
- item name
- brand/designer
- size
- price paid
- sold price (if applicable)
- date of purchase
- more to come...

Beyond simply keeping track of the wardrobe collection, the app also provides insightful 
statistics. Users can explore changes in the amount of money spent from year to year, 
identify their favorite brands and more.

## Who will use it?
From fashion enthusiasts like me to professionals working 
in the fashion industry, it appeals to a broad audience.

## Why is this project of interest to you? 
I have a big collection of clothes from various designer labels and purchased from different places. 
However, I never know **how many** items I own in my collection, 
nor do I know **how much money** I have spent on them. 
Therefore, I am interested in building an app to track my wardrobe collection.
