# Wardrobe 
## What is it and what will it do?
Wardrobe is a desktop app that models the user's wardrobe. It records one's apparel collection, 
including clothes, pants, shoes, and accessories all in one place.
It allows users to keep track many features of their apparel collection, includingï¼š

- category
- item name
- brand/designer
- size
- price paid
- sold price (if applicable)
- date of purchase
- more to come...

Beyond simply keeping track of the wardrobe collection, the app also provides insightful 
statistics. Users can explore changes in the amount of money spent from year to year, 
identify their favorite brands and more.

## Who will use it?
From fashion enthusiasts like me to professionals working 
in the fashion industry, it appeals to a broad audience.

## Why is this project of interest to you? 
I have a big collection of clothes from various designer labels and purchased from different places. 
However, I never know **how many** items I own in my collection, 
nor do I know **how much money** I have spent on them. 
Therefore, I am interested in building an app to track my wardrobe collection.

# Phase 4: Task 3 -- Reflection

**Nested Classes in WardrobeGUI**

For the GUI of my program, I created a class called WardrobeGUI with a lot of nested classes in it. 
The nested pattern allows the inner classes to have direct access to the fields and methods of the enclosing class, 
so that I do not have to create and call certain getter or setter methods for passing and getting references.
However, the nested classes also made my WardrobeGUI class very lengthy. The readability of code in 
this class is somehow affected. 
To enhance readability, I could consider separating all nested classes from the WardrobeGUI class 
and making them into individual classes. This would help make the code more readable and maintainable. 
However, there are also tradeoffs for this refactoring, such as introducing a lot of coupling.

**Enum for the category field**

The Apparel class includes a category field that currently accepts any string value. 
Given that there are a fixed set of desirable values ("Tops", "Bottoms", "Shoes"), 
it would be more appropriate to define an enum named Category and use it in the Apparel 
class. This change would ensure type safety and restrict the category values to the 
predefined set.
